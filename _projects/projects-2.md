title: "AI-Powered Smart Auto-Aiming RC Toy Car with Turret"
excerpt: "The purpose of this project is to participate in the Innovative AI Applications EEE Contest 2024, which is currently ongoing. We have developed a mobile phone app-controlled turret-equipped vehicle capable of automatic targeting, firing soft foam projectiles, and movement. The Raspberry Pi serves as the main controller, establishing a TCP connection with the phone through a mobile hotspot. The vehicle can stream real-time camera footage to the phone while receiving movement commands via buttons on the app. The foam projectile launcher features an 8-round magazine for rapid fire and incorporates mathematical modeling to calculate distances to stationary circular targets based on their apparent size, enabling precision shooting. A distinctive feature of this project is its integration with GPT-4. My custom app implements this AI system, allowing users to converse with the vehicle, which responds through real-time text-to-speech. The pan-tilt mechanism enables expressive movements like nodding and shaking, while a front-mounted dot-matrix screen visually displays the vehicle's emotional states - an engaging interactive element. Additional functionalities are currently under development to enhance these capabilities. <br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"
