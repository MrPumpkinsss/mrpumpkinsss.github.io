title: "Projects item number 1"
excerpt: "This project won the EIE Microcontroller Application Design Contest (2023-24). It combines Raspberry Pi and Arduino. Raspberry Pi is responsible for image recognition and transmits target coordinate information to Arduino through I2C. Arduino adjusts the pan-tilt through PID to aim at the target. Regarding the electromagnetic gun, the design of the electromagnetic gun circuit is the most difficult. The capacitor must first be charged to about 250V in about ten seconds. The Arduino trigger signal is controlled by the mobile phone Bluetooth signal to turn on the thyristor, allowing a current of up to tens of amperes to flow through the coil, generating a strong magnetic field and shooting the magnet in the barrel out at high speed. In order to accelerate the magnet, this project designed a two-stage coil to further accelerate the magnet by precisely controlling the time difference.<br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"
